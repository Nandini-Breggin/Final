FINAL PROJECT:

Task:
-----
Create an interactive website using javascript, html, and css that processes data to solve a real, non-trivial problem for a targeted set of users.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISSION STATEMENT:
------------------
Target Audience -> Racecar/kart drivers
Problem to Solve -> Help people see how prepared they are for their next race.
Why? -> To help people see how much more practice they need to do their best in the race.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS FOR WEBSITE:
------
- Background information
    - Tips and tricks -> Hover with a lightbulb picture (word-study challenge)
- Take a quiz to see how prepared they are for their next race.
    - How consistent are they with their lines
    - How often do they practice
    - How far off are they from the T.R.
    - How well do you know the track?
    - How confident are they?
    - How well do you know your competition?
- Give feedback after the quiz, to help them go faster?
* How to make it process information?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MUST HAVES:
-----------
* DOCUMENT WITH COMMENTS -> something new you learned
    -> Not something we went over together in class
        ~ Find out how to save the data on the page
* Functions
* Variables
* Event Handling (interactive / storing data)
* Objects
* Conditional Statements
* Repetition (Loop???)
* Version Control (Upload to GitHub - Commiting)
* Lists / Arrays
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Calendar
    - Track/Seat Time (weekly, daily, monthly?)
        - Set Goal (Tracks it)
        - Logs it everytime
            - It needs to save the progress
